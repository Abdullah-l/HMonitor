# HMonitor
HMonitor is an HTTP request monitor for changes.

I wrote this script to monitor a GET request for changes every 20 secs.

You can change [GET Request URL](https://github.com/cupOJ/HMonitor/blob/ceb3ef389f0a0e2c68be2ab1511e79aa771921eb/HMonitor.py#L7) to suit your needs.

> Note: The program is set to play a very [loud alert](https://github.com/cupOJ/HMonitor/blob/main/gilfoyle_alert.mp3) when a change is found. You can change the alert sound or remove it. I am not responsible if you have a stroke :) You can blame Gilfoyle

## Usage
 
     python HMonitor.py
