# HMonitor
HMonitor is an HTTP request monitor for changes.

I wrote this script to monitor a GET request for changes every 20 secs.

You can change the code to suit your needs.

Note: The code is set to play a very loud alert when a change is found. You can change the alert sound or remove it.

Usage: python HMonitor.py
